  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h5><b>Information</b></h5>
  <p> Group 6 Travelling are specialists in Lapland’s nature and the Lappish lifestyle. 
    Since 1982, we have provided tourists visiting Lapland with exciting nature activities and memorable
     travel experiences. At the heart of our activities lies the culture of Lapland. 
     We draw inspiration from the local history and day-to-day ‘Lappishness’. 
     The stories and legends related to these principles form the basis of the programme packages offered to our customers.
     </p>
     <h5>Nature</h5>
     <p>The nature of Lapland is the most sensitive member of our team. 
       We observe the principles of sustainable development and scale all of our activities 
       according to the tolerance of the natural environment. 
       We guide our guests to respect nature and to get close with it in a Lappish way, 
       allowing them to enjoy their nature outing with a clean conscience.
       The area of Lapland was split between two counties of the Swedish Realm from 1634 to 1809. 
       The northern and western areas were part of Västerbotten County, while the southern areas were part of Ostrobothnia County (after 1755 Oulu County). 
       The northern and western areas were transferred in 1809 to Oulu County, which became Oulu Province. Under the royalist constitution of Finland during the first half of 1918, 
       Lapland was to become a Grand Principality and part of the inheritance of the proposed king of Finland. Lapland Province was separated from Oulu Province in 1938.

  <!--     <h5>History</h5>
       <p>
       During the Interim Peace and beginning of the Continuation War the government of Finland allowed the Nazi German Army to station itself in Lapland as a part of Operation Barbarossa. 
       After Finland made a separate peace with the Soviet Union in 1944, the Soviet Union demanded that Finland expel the German army from its soil. The result was the Lapland War, 
       during which almost the whole civilian population of Lapland was evacuated. The Germans used scorched earth tactics in Lapland, before they withdrew to Norway. 
       Forty to forty-seven percent of the dwellings in Lapland and 417 kilometres (259 mi) of railroads were destroyed, 9,500 kilometres (5,900 mi) of roadways were mined, 
       destroyed or were unusable, and 675 bridges and 3,700 kilometres (2,300 mi) of telephone lines were also destroyed. Ninety percent of Rovaniemi, the capital of Lapland, 
       waLapland was reorganised as one of the new regions that replaced them.
